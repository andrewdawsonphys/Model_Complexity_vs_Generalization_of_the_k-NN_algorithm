This project was inspired by Chapter 2 of 'Introduction to Machine Learningwith Python: A Guide for Data Scientists' written by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido. The project was an investigation into how model complexities are closely related to the generalization of a model using the k-NN machine learning algorithm as an example.
